dcrinstall
==========

## Overview

dcrinstall is a tool to automate the install, upgrade, and setup
process for the decred software.

In install mode dcrinstall downloads the latest released binaries of
dcrd, dcrwallet, dcrctl, and promptsecret for your operating system
and platform, installs them, sets up the config files, and creates a
wallet for you.  In upgrade mode, dcrinstall replaces your binaries
with the latest copies but makes no changes to your configs.

Additionally, when the `--dcrdex` flag is set the tool will attempt to install
the Decred DEX and bitcoin daemon.

## Upgrading an existing installation

The following steps are required to upgrade a system with decred that
was not installed by dcrinstall.  If you already have decred installed
you will need to follow these instructions the first time.

The dcrinstall tool expects the following directory layout.  In order
to upgrade you must copy your current configuration files into the
correct location and ensure everything still works.  You may also want
to copy you executables to the directory dcrinstall expects as well.

If dcrinstall detects all configuration files it'll operate in upgrade
mode.  Upgrade mode only overwrites the binaries in %HOMEPATH%\decred (or
~/decred on a UNIX type OS).

The dcrinstall tool records all actions in %HOMEPATH%\decred\dcrinstall.log
(or ~/decred/dcrinstall.log on a UNIX type OS).

## Using a proxy

To provide additional privacy `dcrinstall` has proxy and tor support.
Simply set the `HTTP_PROXY` environment variable to a suitable proxy.

For example using tor over localhost:
```
export HTTP_PROXY='socks5://127.0.0.1:9050'
```

To use an http proxy that requires authentication:
```
export HTTP_PROXY='http://user:password@myproxyserver.com:3128'
```

Then run all `dcrinstall` as described in this document.

### Windows

Configuration files:
```
%LOCALAPPDATA%\Dcrctl\dcrctl.conf
%LOCALAPPDATA%\Dcrd\dcrd.conf
%LOCALAPPDATA%\Dcrwallet\dcrwallet.conf
%LOCALAPPDATA%\Dexc\dexc.conf
%LOCALAPPDATA%\Dexcctl\dexcctl.conf
%ROAMINGAPPDATA%\Bitcoind\bitcoin.conf
```

Binaries directory:
```
%HOMEPATH%\decred\
```

### OSX

Configuration files:
```
~/Library/Application Support/Dcrctl/dcrctl.conf
~/Library/Application Support/Dcrd/dcrd.conf
~/Library/Application Support/Dcrwallet/dcrwallet.conf
~/Library/Application Support/Dexc/dexc.conf
~/Library/Application Support/Dexcctl/dexcctl.conf
~/Library/Application Support/Bitcoind/bitcoin.conf
```

Binaries directory:
```
~/decred
```

### UNIX

Configuration files:
```
~/.dcrctl/dcrctl.conf
~/.dcrd/dcrd.conf
~/.dcrwallet/dcrwallet.conf
~/.dexc/dexc.conf
~/.dexcctl/dexcctl.conf
~/.bitcoind/bitcoin.conf
```

Binaries directory:
```
~/decred
```

### Run the software

Now that you have the files where dcrinstall can find them you can
download and run dcrinstall

For Windows:

Open a cmd.exe window then:

```
cd %HOMEPATH%\Download
dcrinstall.exe
```

For OSX and UNIX you will also need to make the file executable before
runnning it:

```
cd Downloads/
chmod u+x dcrinstall
./dcrinstall
```
and you installation will be upgraded to the latest released version.

To install the optional DCRDEX software add the `--dcrdex` flag. For example:
```
cd %HOMEPATH%\Download
dcrinstall.exe --dcrdex
```

## Clean install

If you are doing a clean install (no existing decred configuration
files) you can just run dcrinstall and it will setup and configure all
the binaries:

For Windows open a cmd.exe window and:
```
cd %HOMEPATH%\Download
dcrinstall.exe
```

For OSX and UNIX:

```
cd Downloads/
./dcrinstall
```

You will be asked to provide a passphrase for you wallet and given the
opportunity to use and existing wallet seed if you have one.

## Log file

dcrinstall saves a log file with information on everything it did
which you may examine if you need more information.  On Windows the
file is located at:

```
%HOMEPATH%\decred\dcrinstaller.log
```

On OSX and UNIX the file is located at:

```
~/decred/dcrinstaller.log
```

## Running decred programs

On Windows open cmd.exe

```
%HOMEPATH%\decred\dcrd.exe
```

One OSX and UNIX like systems:

```
cd decred/
./dcrd
```

Alternatively you can add the directory to your path.  For windows see
http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm  For OSX and UNIX
refer to the documentation for your shell.

## Build from source

dcrinstall can be used from the provided binaries but if you prefer to
build from source you can use these steps.  The
following instructions are for OSX and UNIX only.

```
mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/decred
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/decred
git clone https://github.com/decred/decred-release
cd decred-release
go install ./cmd/...
```

## Public Keys

The file
[cmd/dcrinstall/pubkey.go](https://github.com/decred/decred-release/blob/master/cmd/dcrinstall/pubkey.go)
contains the decred public key which is used to check the signed
manifest in the release.  You can compare the contents of this file to
what you get from a keyserver to confirm that dcrinstaller is using
the proper key.

## Notes

dcrinstall can only install decred releases v0.1.6 or later only
(although as described above it can be used to upgrade from an older
version).

dcrinstall has been tested on Windows 10, Windows 7, OSX 10.11, Bitrig current,
OpenBSD, Fedora, Ubuntu, and Raspbian.
