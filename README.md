Decred Release

This repository contains the decred installer.

go to [decred-binaries](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries).

## Verifying Binaries

Each release contains a manifest file with sha256 hashes for the
binaries in that release.  To verify these, you will need:

* SHA256 - Once you download your file(s), you need to check their
  SHA256 hashes, so you may need to download a tool to do this,
  depending on your OS.
* GnuPG or PGP - This is required to import public keys and verify
  signatures. Examples below use GnuPG.

The steps to verify the binaries are as follows:

1. Download the file manifest, the signature for the file manifest, and the binary for your OS from here.
2. Obtain the SHA256 value for the binary for your OS and check that it matches the value in the file manifest, e.g. for 64-bit Linux

   ```
   $ sha256sum dcrinstall-linux-amd64-v0.3.0
   a53004599daeab51c0e86af026748b7aa55ff9e5d4844bef3b7d8ccf8a5d72a9  dcrinstall-linux-amd64-v0.3.0
   ```

3. Import the Decred Release Signing Key in GnuPG.
   ```
   $ gpg --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --recv-keys 0x518A031D
      gpg: requesting key 518A031D from hkp server pgp.mit.edu
      gpg: /home/user/.gnupg/trustdb.gpg: trustdb created
      gpg: key 7608AF04: public key "Decred Release <release@decred.org>" imported
      gpg: Total number processed: 1
      gpg: imported: 1 (RSA: 1)
   ```
4. Verify the signature for the file manifest is valid and created by
the Decred Release Signing Key.

	```
   $ gpg --verify manifest-dcrinstall-v0.3.0.txt.asc
      gpg: assuming signed data in `manifest-dcrinstall-v0.3.0.txt'
      gpg: Signature made Wed 27 Jan 2016 08:56:59 PM UTC using RSA key ID 518A031D
      gpg: Good signature from "Decred Release <release@decred.org>"
      gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
      gpg: There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
          Primary key fingerprint: FD13 B683 5E24 8FAF 4BD1 838D 6DF6 34AA 7608 AF04
           Subkey fingerprint: F516 ADB7 A069 852C 7C28 A02D 6D89 7EDF 518A 031D
   ```

The binary for your platform is now verified and you can be confident
they were generated by the Decred team.
